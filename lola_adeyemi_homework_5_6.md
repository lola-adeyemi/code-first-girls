TASK 1 (Agile Techniques)

Question 1
Complete definitions for Scrum related key terminology provided below.
SCRUM CEREMONIES
·        Product backlog refinement
Product owner (and other members of the team if needed) review the tasks on the backlog. This ensures that tasks in backlog remain appropriate and can be prioritised if needed. This helps prevent implementing the wrong tasks and makes sure the backlog tasks are relevant and focused.
·        Sprint planning
A meeting event that defines the tasks of the next sprint. In this meeting the team decide the tasks from the backlog to complete for the next sprint. At the end of the sprint planning the team will have a clear understanding of what is being delivered next.
·        Daily scrum.
A very brief meeting (timeboxed to 15 minutes) which usually starts at the beginning of the day. The daily scrum allows the team to briefly state what they did yesterday, what they are doing today and if there is anything blocking their work. Any issues raised can then be investigated offline.
·        Sprint review.
This is a review of the previously run sprint. In this review the team discuss what was accomplished, what tasks changed and what tasks were blocked. This then allows the team to revise the backlog ready for the next sprint.
·        Sprint retrospective
This is a team meeting where the last sprint is reviewed for what worked well and what didn’t work well. This is then used to see how the next sprint can be improved.
 
 SCRUM ROLES
·        ScrumMaster
A scrum master helps ensures the scrum approach is adopted by the team. The help ensure all scrum activities are carried out and remove barriers to the team’s progress.
·        Product Owner
Defines and manages the product backlog to achieve the required product functionality. The product owner focuses on bring value to the end user of the product and defines and updates the product goal.
·        Development Team.
A development team is a team made of professional individuals who each work on an increment task incrementing the task to “done”.
 
Question 2
 
You are leading a development team that was given a task to create a new yoga booking system.

High level description of the system is as follows:
 
·        It has a very simple interface to accept user input (bookings) and display classes information
·        All bookings, appointments, schedules etc should be stored in a SQL database.
·        There is a ‘backend’ system that should be written in Python to handle the logic and manage the data flow. 
Your team has two weeks to build a simple prototype that will be shown to the client to seek their feedback and discuss further enhancements.
 

TASK
·        Break this task into smaller stories (chunks of work) for the team to work on.
·        Assume that one person works on one task.
·        Mark tasks that can be worked on in parallel and perhaps those that need to be worked on in particular order.
 
For this task the following is the user story that has been created to fulfil the simple prototype requirement:
User story
1.	User goes to website
2.	User enters a class name in the search field
3.	Class name is retrieved through GET function (user doesn’t see)
4.	Connection to MySQL Database is used to retrieve class information (user doesn’t see)
5.	Class details is sent using POST function (user doesn’t see)
6.	Pre-loaded class details is shown on website
7.	No further interaction

In a diagram, the high-level description of the system is:
